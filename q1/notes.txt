top = top word in stack
left = second top word in stack

if top related to left
    if left is root
        if words still in buffer
            shift
    elif top is head of left
        left arc, get dep's dep label
    elif top is dep of left
        if top has dep to the right
            shift
        else
            right arc, get top's dep label
else
    shift


mirror of this?
if top has dependency to the right
            shift


NVM actually alwayse choose left arc over shift
choosing shift over left-arc?
    if top is head of left
        if top has a head to the right,
